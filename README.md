# Evolutionary dynamics of intra-tumoral heterogenoeous systems 
_An analytic and numeric coincidence to understand the dynamics of multi-compartmental biologic structures_

## Introduction

The unwelcome evolution of malignancy during cancer progression emerges through a
selection process in a complex heterogeneous population structure. In the present work, we
investigate evolutionary dynamics in a phenotypically heterogeneous population of stem
cells (SCs) and their associated progenitors. The fate of a malignant mutation is determined
not only by overall stem cell and non-stem cell growth rates but also differentiation and dedifferentiation
rates. 

## Project results

We investigate the effect of such a complex population structure on the
evolution of malignant mutations. We derive exactly calculated results for the fixation probability
of a mutant arising in each of the subpopulations. The exactly calculated results are in
almost perfect agreement with the numerical simulations. Moreover, a condition for evolutionary
advantage of a mutant cell versus the wild type population is given in the present
study. We also show that microenvironment-induced plasticity in invading mutants leads to
more aggressive mutants with higher fixation probability. Our model predicts that decreasing
polarity between stem and non-stem cells' turnover would raise the survivability of nonplastic
mutants; while it would suppress the development of malignancy for plastic mutants.
The derived results are novel and general with potential applications in nature; we discuss
our model in the context of colorectal/intestinal cancer (at the epithelium). However, the
model clearly needs to be validated through appropriate experimental data. This novel
mathematical framework can be applied more generally to a variety of problems concerning
selection in heterogeneous populations, in other contexts such as population genetics, and
ecology.
